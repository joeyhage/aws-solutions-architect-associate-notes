### OSI 7-Layer Model

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)

ðŸ’¡ A layer 1 device only understands layer 1 whereas a layer 3 device understands layers 1, 2, and 3

#### Media layers

- Physical, data link, network
- Dealing with how data is moved between point A and point B

#### Host layers

- Transport, session, presentation, application
- How data is chunked/grouped and reassembled as well as formatted so it can be understood

#### Physical (layer 1)

##### Overview

- Transmission and reception of raw bit streams (zeros and ones) between a device and a shared physical medium
- Physical medium can be copper (electrical), fiber (light), or WIFI (radio frequency)
- Defines voltage levels, timing, rates, distances, modulation, and connectors

##### Example: Hubs

- Anything which a hub receives on any port is re-transmitted on all other ports, including errors and collisions
- At layer one, no individual device addresses
- If multiple devices transmit at once, a collision occurs and all information is useless
- No media access control. i.e. cannot control which devices are allowed to transmit
- Collisions are almost guaranteed - likelihood increases with # of devices
- layer 1 cannot detect when collisions occur
- layer 1 networks do not scale well
- no device to device communication
- layer 1 is only practical when layer 2 is added on top

#### Data link (layer 2)

- requires layer 1 (OSI higher layers rely on all layers below itself)
- One of the most critical layers because it supports all data transfer
- Detects and mitigates data collisions
- Data link frame: format for sending information over a layer 2 network
- Layer 2 introduces MAC address: uniquely assigned to a piece of hardware
  - two parts: OUI (manufacturer) and network interface controller (NIC) specific
  - MAC address should be globally unique
- layer 2 networks can only communicate with other layer 2 networks that use the same protocol (e.g. ethernet)
- most common protocol for local networks is ethernet
  - long distance, point to point links use protocols like PPP/MPLS/ATM

##### Frame

- **Preamble:** start of the frame
- MAC header
  - **Destination MAC address**
  - **Source MAC address:** allows it to receive replies
  - **Ether type (ET):** the layer 3 protocol is being used. Example: internet protocol (IP)
- Payload
  - the data being sent via the layer 3 protocol
  - 46-1500 bytes
- Frame check sequence (FCS)
  - Cyclic redundancy check (CRC)
  - Allows destination to check for accidental data errors/changes/corruption

##### CSMA/CD

- carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)
  - check for carrier -> if no carrier, layer 1 takes the frame data and transmits
- collision detection (CD)
  - if collision is detected, a jam signal is sent by all devices and a random backoff occurs. Then it retries. Process repeats, with increasing backoffs, if necessary.
- **encapsulation:** wrapping data inside something else (e.g. wrapping data in a frame)
- **Unicast communication:** 1 to 1
- **Broadcase communication**: 1 to all

##### Example: Switches

- Understands layer 2 
- maintains a MAC address table and keeps track of addresses attached to which port
- if it receives a frame and **knows** which port the destination address belongs to, it will send it to that port only
- if it receives a frame and **does not know** which port the destination address belongs to, it will send it to all other ports
- switches store the frame, forward it, and then discard it
- switches do not forward collisions so each port is a separate collision domain which reduces collisions

#### Network (layer 3)

- Internet protocol (IP) is a layer 3 protocol
  - add cross-network IP addressing and routing between LANs without direct P2P
- routers are L3 devices that remove frame encapsulation and add new frame encapsulation at every hop

##### L3 IP packet structure

- destination and source addresses don't have to be in the same LAN like with L2
- the frame changes for each LAN the frame is moving through
  - **the packet doesn't change!**

##### IPv4

packet fields (only a subset that is relevant right now)

- source and destination IP addresses
- data: from layer 4 protocol
- protocol: ICMP (1), TCP (6), UDP (17)
- Time to live (TTL): max number of hops the packet can take before being discarded

IP addressing

- dotted decimal notation
  - e.g. 127.0.0.1
  - 4 decimals 0-255
  - all IP addresses have a network and a host part
    - the prefix (e.g. /24, /16) determines which is the network part and which is the host part
  - two IP addresses are on the same IP network if the network part is the same
- subnet mask determines if the IP address is local or remote
  - if remote, it needs to use the default gateway

##### IPv6

packet fields (subset)

- source and destination IP addresses (bigger, more possible addresses)
  - more space taken in the packet
- data: from layer 4 protocol
- Hop limit: max number of hops the packet can take before being discarded

##### Route tables & routes

- routers have one to many route tables
  - a route table consists of a destination and the next hop/target to get there (e.g. the gateway to the network)
- router chooses the most specific destination route
  - that means whichever matches and has the highest prefix number because there are fewer host IP addresses
- route tables have a default route that matches if nothing else does
- border gateway protocol (BGP) allows routers to communicate to each other networks they know
- routers wrap packets in frames and forward at layer 2

#### Transport (layer 4)



#### Session (layer 5)



#### Presentation (layer 6)



#### Application (layer 7)

### Decimal to IP Conversion (IP Addressing)

- Dotted decimal notation (4 decimal numbers e.g. 127.0.0.1)
