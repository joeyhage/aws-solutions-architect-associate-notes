# IAM, Accounts and AWS Organizations

## IAM identity policies

### IAM policy document

- 1+ statements
- allow or deny
- if no explicit allow, then implicitly denied
- rule precedence
  - explicit denies -> explicit allows -> implicitly denied
  - i.e. deny -> allow -> deny

### Managed IAM policies

- best practice because reusable
- two types: AWS defined and customer defined
- normal, default "business" rights
- low management overhead
- use inline policies for exceptions

## IAM users

- üìù identity used for long-term access to AWS account
  - üìù used 99% of the time for named, tangible things that need access
  - üìù could be humans, applications, service accounts
- authenticates via one of two ways: username and password (human) or access keys (app/service account)

## ARNs

- syntax:
  - `arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-id`
  - `arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-type/resource-id`
  - `arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-type:resource-id`
- partition is almost always `aws` except beijing/china is `aws-cn`
- sometimes region/account-id can be omitted
  - `arn:aws:s3:::catgifs` - no region or account id needed because S3 buckets are globally unique
- ‚ùó common gotchas with ARNs
  - `arn:aws:s3:::catgifs` is very different from `arn:aws:s3:::catgifs/*`
  - `arn:aws:s3:::catgifs` grants access to bucket and operations on bucket
  - `arn:aws:s3:::catgifs/*` grants access to objects in bucket and operations on those objects
  - these two **do not** overlap

### IAM exam tips

- üìù 5,000 IAM users per account
- üìù IAM user can be member of max 10 groups
- can be a system design limit
  - üìù alternatives: IAM roles and identity federation

## IAM groups

- containers for IAM users - used for organization and to ease management
  - üìù cannot login to a group
- üìù could have all 5,000 IAM users in an account in one IAM group
- üìù no "all users" IAM group
- üìù cannot nest IAM groups, groups within groups
- soft limit of 300 groups per account, can be increased by support
- üìù groups are not a true identity, cannot be referred to as a Principal or from an IAM policy

## IAM roles

- identity used by multiple (or unknown number of) principals
- roles are assumed when logging in, you become that role for a short period of time
- can have two types of policies:
  - **trust policy**: controls which identities can assume the role
    - can reference identities in same account, other accounts, anonymous access, or other types using OIDC (Facebook, Google, etc)
  - **permissions policy**: access policy specific to the role. policy is checked every time credentials are used so changes to permissions policy are immediate.
- if trust policy allows access, identity receives temporary security credentials

### When to use IAM roles

- execution roles: avoids needing to hardcode credentials in code (e.g. Lambda execution role)
- emergency roles: temporary, elevated access that is recorded/logged when used. "break glass" role
- existing identities (ID federation): AD/SSO or > 5000 identities

### Service linked roles and PassRole

- linked to specific AWS service
- predefined by service, service may create/delete role
- provides permissions a service needs to interact with other AWS services
- ‚ùó can't delete role until no longer required (distinction from IAM role)
- PassRole: permission to provision service to use an existing service linked role

## AWS Organizations

- Have one organization main/master/management/payer account and zero to many member accounts
- Consolidated billing means one bill for all AWS accounts
- Consolidates reservations and volume discounts
- Best practice: use IAM roles, store all identities in a single identity account or use federation with that one identity account
